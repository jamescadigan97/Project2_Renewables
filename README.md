# Renewable Energy Visualizations
In this project production we examined renewable energy production data by state and created visualizations to show how it is distributed throughout the United States. We created a heatmap to show the locations of all the renewable energy power plants. We then created cloropeth maps to show production of the three main types of renewable energy. We ultized Plotly JavaScript to build a sunburst chart that shows the distribution of energy production in the US. We constructed a webscraping function to display articles on All the chart use 2019 production data from eia.org. The app is powered by Flask and runs on Amazon Web Services.

We have similar charts for wind and solar energy

On the site it is dynamic and you can filter what type of energy production plants you want to see.

On the site the sunburst map is dynamic and the list can be updated.
